## Mobile Note taking app

To get started in mobile development I built a simple note taking app in both SwiftUI and Flutter. I also built a fully featured API as a backend with JWT authentication.

### Technologies Used
- Postgresql
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- JWT Authentication
- SwiftUI
- Flutter

### Features
- JWT Username & Password authentication
- Note creation,read, update, and delete functionality
- The Flutter app has a bit more UI work with a bottom navigation bar to different pages for additional features
- I started work on a chrome extension to automatically upload bookmarks to the users account but is a WIP
